        <h2>About NPVIS</h2>
        <p><strong>Neural Processing Validation &amp; Integrity Solutions (NPVIS)</strong> exists to bring clarity, trust, and accountability to rapidly evolving AI systems. We help builders validate models <em>before</em> they scale by combining automated adversarial testing with process-aware checks that reflect how AI is actually used in products and workflows.</p>

        <h3>What We Do</h3>
        <p>Traditional red-teaming focuses on <em>what</em> a model says. We also test <em>how</em> it works inside a real process. Our MVP audit harness identifies jailbreaks, prompt/indirect injection, sensitive-data leakage, tool/argument abuse, and bias. It also evaluates <strong>chain-of-work reasoning</strong>, <strong>workflow compliance</strong>, and <strong>pipeline robustness</strong>—the operational failure modes that sink many enterprise AI pilots.</p>

        <h3>How We Do It</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Adversarial Red-Team Suites:</strong> multilingual/domain-specific probes for jailbreaks, injection, leakage, tool abuse, and cost/DoS risks.</li>
            <li><strong>Process &amp; Accountability Checks:</strong> validate “chain-of-work” steps and test whether the model follows the required sequence, with optional human-augmented confirmations.</li>
            <li><strong>Integrity Metrics:</strong> evasion and severe-violation rates, fairness deltas, hallucination risk, and schema/tool handling to quantify operational fitness.</li>
            <li><strong>Governance Mapping:</strong> findings aligned to NIST AI-RMF and MITRE ATLAS for defensible reporting to customers, investors, and regulators.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Who We Serve</h3>
        <p>We focus on <strong>nascent AI startups</strong> and fast-moving teams that need credible assurance without slowing down. Our scorecards are concise, actionable, and designed to unblock sales, partnerships, and investor diligence.</p>

        <h3>Our Roots</h3>
        <p>NPVIS grew out of Johns Hopkins MBA cohorts with deep experience in intelligence, security, and systems engineering. We’re building practical, evidence-based audits that help founders ship AI safely—and earn trust as they scale.</p>
