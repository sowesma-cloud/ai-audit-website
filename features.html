        <h2>Our Capabilities</h2>
        <p>SecureLLM offers a comprehensive suite of tools and services to evaluate and secure your language models. Our approach aligns with responsible AI practices recommended by leading organizations. Microsoft notes that red teaming is an important practice in identifying harms and informing mitigations for LLM applications【47827325534835†L68-L92】. We build on this philosophy to deliver the following capabilities:</p>
        <h3>Adversarial Prompt Corpus</h3>
        <p>We curate and maintain an extensive corpus of adversarial prompts across multiple categories, including jailbreak attempts, prompt injections, sensitive information leakage and tool abuse. These prompts are designed to uncover potential weaknesses and policy evasion tactics in your models.</p>
        <h3>Automated Test Harness</h3>
        <p>Our harness automates the process of sending adversarial prompts to your model, capturing responses, and evaluating outcomes. The evaluation layer uses heuristic and machine learning–based detectors to identify violations of your safety policies. Results are aggregated into metrics like evasion rate per category and overall risk scores.</p>
        <h3>Risk Management & Governance</h3>
        <p>We provide guidance on establishing a governance process that aligns with frameworks such as the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and Microsoft’s recommended red teaming practices. This includes defining risk tiers, assembling diverse red‑teamers【47827325534835†L94-L115】, and ensuring coverage across model and application layers【47827325534835†L149-L161】.</p>
        <h3>Continuous Hardening</h3>
        <p>Our platform supports iterative testing cycles. After each round of testing, we assist you in implementing mitigations—such as safety tune-ups, additional filters, or prompt adjustments—and then retest to measure improvements. Continuous monitoring ensures that your models remain resilient as threats evolve.</p>
